The recipients of the awards are thanking all developers who contributed to the success of the Rocq Prover, the users who illustrated how to use Coq for so many impressive projects in formal certification, programming, logic, formalization of mathematics and teaching as well as the whole surrounding scientific community in proof theory, type theory, programming languages, interactive theorem proving.

All over 40 years, the Rocq prover (which was previously known as Coq) also benefited from the trust and support from Inria and from its partners, CNRS, ENS Lyon, University Paris-Sud, Ã‰cole Polytechnique, University Paris-Diderot.
