The most common question we get is how to contribute to the overall multicore effort. As I [noted last year](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-prerequisite-patches-appearing-in-released-ocaml-compilers-now/4408), we are now in the process of steadily upstreaming our efforts to mainline OCaml. Therefore, the best way by far to contribute is to test for regressions or opportunities for improvements in the patches that are outstanding in the main OCaml repository.
