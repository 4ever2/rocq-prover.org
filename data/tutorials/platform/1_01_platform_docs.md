  Documentation and Tutorials for the Rocq Platform
category: "Documentation"
---

The [Rocq Platform Docs](https://coq.inria.fr/platform-docs/) aims to collaboratively create an action-oriented and interactive documentation for Coq and its Platform.
Each core functionality and plugin of Coq and the Coq Platform will have one or several interactive tutorials and/or how-to guides explaining how to use them in practice. 
They should further be available online through an interactive interface, which this website is a demo page.

The first tutorials are already available and can be checked out below. They can either be run interactively in a web browser thanks to JsCoq, or downloaded and run with a text editor able to interact with Rocq.
