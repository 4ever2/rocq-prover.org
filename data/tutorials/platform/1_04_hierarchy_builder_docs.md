## What is Hierarchy Builder?

Hierarchy Builder is a plugin for Rocq that provides high level commands to
declare a hierarchy of structures. It turns a synthetic description of a
structure into the low-level Rocq commands required to declare the structure,
while ensuring that a few good properties hold.
