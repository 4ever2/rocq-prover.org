**The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.**

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Rocq Prover.

Separation Logic Foundations is an in-depth introduction to separation logic—a practical approach to modular verification of imperative programs—and how to build program verification tools on top of it.
