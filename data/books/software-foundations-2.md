**The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.**

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Rocq prover. 

Programming Language Foundations surveys the theory of programming languages, including operational semantics, Hoare logic, and static type systems.
