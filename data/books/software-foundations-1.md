**The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.**

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Rocq prover. 

Logical Foundations is the entry-point to the series. It covers functional programming, basic concepts of logic, 
  computer-assisted theorem proving, and Rocq.
