**The Software Foundations series is a broad introduction to the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.**

The principal novelty of the series is that every detail is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text of each volume, including the exercises, is literally a "proof script" for the Rocq prover. 

Verifiable C is an extended hands-on tutorial on specifying and verifying real-world C programs using the Princeton Verified Software Toolchain.
