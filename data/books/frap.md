  Formal Reasoning About Programs (FRAP) is a book that provides a general introduction to formal logical reasoning about the correctness of programs and to using Rocq for this purpose.
  The main narrative of FRAP presents standard program-proof ideas, without rigorous proofs. Matching Rocq code then show how to make it rigorous. Interleaved with that narrative, there are also other lectures' worth of material, for building up more practical background on Rocq itself.
