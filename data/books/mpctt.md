  Modeling and Proving in Computational Type Theory (MPCTT) is a textbook covering topics in computational logic using the Rocq Prover.
  The book provides a foundational theory and a programming language for interactively constructing computational models with machine-checked proofs. As common with programming languages, the book covers foundations, case studies, and practical programming in an interleaved fashion.
