    <h1>Sustaining the evolution of Coq while giving a voice to stakeholders</h1>
    <p>
    For many years, the development of Coq has been supported and funded almost exclusively 
    by French academic institutions, most notably Inria. But today, there are intensive Coq users, 
    and thus major stakeholders, in universities and companies all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    The objective of the Consortium is to empower this community of users, whose research and 
    development critically rely on the Coq system. For these users, making sure that the system's 
    maintenance is well funded is essential. They can do so by providing resources either as donations, 
    Consortium membership or support service subscriptions. Furthermore, Consortium members and support 
    service subscribers get a voice in the evolution of Coq, by determining where some engineering resources are allocated.
    </p>
    <p>
    To summarize, on the one hand, we wish to establish transparent ways of contributing financially 
    and technically to the development of the system; on the other hand we wish to make sure that the 
    most pressing needs of major stakeholders are addressed efficiently by providing a fantastic working 
    environment to competent Coq developers.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Rocq Consortium is hosted by Inria (the French national institute for research in digital science and technology), 
    the premier actor behind the development of the Rocq prover.
